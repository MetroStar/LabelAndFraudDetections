In this scenerio we identify fraudulent formulas by taking a look at how closely one formula resembles another formula in the dataset. Doing this in an iterative and automated way can be a powerful way to identify fraudulent activity at the time it is submitted.\n",

Additionally, we assign columns for up to 90 additional ingredients that could be present in the formula. We are left with 100 features: <br>\n",

We cluster this data into five categories which we will label with common types of spirits such as Vodka, Rum, and Gin. Here, we also transform this formula data into a dataframe for easier manipulation and analysis later on in the demonstration."

Instead, our mean difference is well below zero, indicating this entry is very closely related to an existing formula.
